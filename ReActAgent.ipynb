    "It is a type of the agentic ai architecture where the agent performs the loop as:-\n",
    "\n",
    " (Reasoning ---> Action ---> Observe ---> Reasoning)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of making a plan(sequence of task) to achieve the end goal, in ReAct architecture, we do the reasoning step by step due to which we go from several loops over the brain and the tools depending upon the question and the question complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the agent gets the question, \n",
    "\n",
    "\"what is the capital city of Nepal and what is the population of the capital city?\" then,\n",
    "It doesn't make the plan to reach the goal, what is does is it first reasons what is the capital city of Nepal and then after the result is accquired, it then finds the population of the result obtained from previous reasoning and in between it calls required tools and observes the answer from the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the other Agent, this Agent is binded with tools too and makes dynamic tool calls if the appropriate tool is avaiable like TavilySearch, bing, Arxiv, Wikipidea etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the base of almost all agentic system and basic architecture for agentic system req uiring the single-agent.\n"
